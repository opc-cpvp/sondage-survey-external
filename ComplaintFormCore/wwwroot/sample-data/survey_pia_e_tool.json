First and foremost, conducting a PIA is a means of helping to ensure compliance with:</p><ul><li>legal requirements set out in the Privacy Act</li><li>the institution or program&rsquo;s enabling legislation</li><li>the requirements of Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) and Government of Canada policies and directives</li></ul><p>Programs and activities must comply with legal and policy requirements. The way they are designed should also incorporate best practices and minimize negative impacts on the privacy of individuals. For example, you should work to reduce the risk that an individual may suffer harm, such as identity theft, reputational damage, physical harm or distress, as a result of your program&rsquo;s handling of their personal information. A PIA may not eliminate such risks altogether, but should help to identify and manage them. There is often more than one way of designing a project. A PIA can help identify the least privacy intrusive way of achieving a legitimate aim.</p>",
